​KeePass is a free, open-source password manager designed to help you securely manage your passwords. It stores all your passwords in an encrypted database, which you can unlock with a single master key. This means you only need to remember one master password to access all your other passwords. The database is encrypted using robust algorithms like AES-256, ChaCha20, and Twofish, ensuring your data remains secure. citeturn0search0
