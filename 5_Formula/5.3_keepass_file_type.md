KeePass primarily utilizes the following file types and extensions:

- **.kdb**: Used by KeePass 1.x versions, this is the original database file format.

- **.kdbx**: Introduced in KeePass 2.x, this is the default database format, offering enhanced features and security. citeturn0search3

Additionally, KeePass supports various other file types:

- **.lngx**: Language files that allow users to translate the KeePass user interface into different languages.

- **.plgx**: Plugin files used to extend KeePass's functionality. citeturn0search0

For importing and exporting data, KeePass supports formats such as CSV, XML, and HTML. These formats facilitate data transfer between KeePass and other applications. citeturn0search2

It's important to note that while the .kdbx extension is standard for KeePass databases, the software can open database files regardless of their extension, as long as the content is in a compatible format. citeturn0search6
