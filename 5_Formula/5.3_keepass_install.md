### **1️⃣ Update Your System**  
Before installing anything, it's always good to update your package list:  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```  
(For Debian/Ubuntu-based distros) ✅  

For Fedora:  
```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```  

For Arch Linux:  
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

### **2️⃣ Install KeePass**  
Now, install KeePass using the package manager of your distro:  

🔹 **Debian/Ubuntu-based distros:**  
```bash
sudo apt install keepass2 -y
```  

🔹 **Fedora:**  
```bash
sudo dnf install keepass -y
```  

🔹 **Arch Linux (via AUR)**:  
```bash
yay -S keepass
```  
(If you don’t have `yay`, install it first: `sudo pacman -S yay`)
