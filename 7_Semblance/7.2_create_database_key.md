It appears you're encountering two issues with KeePassXC:

1. **GUI Application Error**: When attempting to launch `keepassxc`, you receive the following error:

   ```
   qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display 
   qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
   This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

   Available platform plugins are: eglfs, linuxfb, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vnc, xcb.

   Aborted (core dumped)
   ```

   This error suggests that the application is unable to connect to the X server, which is necessary for GUI applications to display. This issue often arises in environments without a graphical interface or when the display isn't properly set up.

2. **CLI Command Misuse**: When using `keepassxc-cli` to create a new database, the following command was executed:

   ```
   keepassxc-cli db-create -p /path/to/database.kdbx
   ```

   The error returned was:

   ```
   Invalid command db-create.
   ```

   Additionally, attempting:

   ```
   keepassxc-cli create -p /path/to/database.kdbx
   ```

   Resulted in:

   ```
   Unknown option 'p'.
   ```

   These errors indicate that the `db-create` command doesn't exist and that the `-p` option is unrecognized for the `create` command.

**Solutions:**

1. **For the GUI Application Error**:

   - **Ensure X Server Availability**: Verify that an X server is running and accessible. In headless or server environments, you might need to set up a virtual frame buffer using tools like `Xvfb`.

   - **Check Display Environment Variable**: Ensure that the `DISPLAY` environment variable is correctly set. You can check its value with:

     ```bash
     echo $DISPLAY
     ```

     If it's unset or incorrect, set it to `:0` or the appropriate display number:

     ```bash
     export DISPLAY=:0
     ```

   - **Install Necessary Packages**: The error mentions the `xcb` plugin. Ensure that the required Qt platform plugins are installed. On Debian-based systems, you can install them with:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0
     ```

     On other distributions, the package name might differ.

   - **Reinstall KeePassXC**: As suggested by the error message, reinstalling KeePassXC might resolve the issue:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get remove keepassxc
     sudo apt-get install keepassxc
     ```

2. **For the CLI Command Misuse**:

   - **Correct Command for Creating a Database**: The correct command to create a new database using `keepassxc-cli` is:

     ```bash
     keepassxc-cli create database.kdbx
     ```

     Note that the `-p` option is not used with the `create` command. After executing this command, you'll be prompted to set a password for the new database.

   - **Refer to the Help Documentation**: To familiarize yourself with the available commands and their options, you can consult the help documentation:

     ```bash
     keepassxc-cli --help
     ```

     For specific command help:

     ```bash
     keepassxc-cli create --help
     ```

By addressing the display connection issue and using the correct CLI commands, you should be able to use both the GUI and CLI versions of KeePassXC effectively.
