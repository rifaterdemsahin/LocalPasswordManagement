It looks like your `keepassxc-cli` command is failing because the database password is incorrect. Here are some things to check and try:  

### 1. **Verify Your Password**  
Make sure that `XXX` is indeed the correct password for `database.kdbx`. Try manually unlocking the database with:  
```sh
keepassxc-cli show database.kdbx
```
If this fails, the password might be incorrect or the database could require a key file.

### 2. **Check If a Key File Is Required**  
If your KeePassXC database uses a key file for authentication, you need to provide it. Try:  
```sh
keepassxc-cli show -k /path/to/keyfile.kdbx database.kdbx
```

### 3. **Manually Open KeePassXC GUI**  
Try opening the database in KeePassXCâ€™s GUI application to confirm the password works.

### 4. **Check If the Database Is Corrupt**  
If the password is correct but still fails, the database file might be corrupted. Try restoring a backup if you have one.

### 5. **Use an Environment Variable for Security**  
Instead of hardcoding your password, try:  
```sh
export PASSWORD="XXX"
echo -e "$PASSWORD\n$PASSWORD" | keepassxc-cli add database.kdbx "TestEntry" -g
```

Try these steps and let me know what happens! ðŸš€
